     ```  
   - Activate the virtual environment:  
     - **Windows:**  
       ```sh
       env\Scripts\activate
       ```  
     - **Mac/Linux:**  
       ```sh
       source env/bin/activate
       ```  

3. **Configure Environment Variables**  
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following:  
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY_HERE}
     GUARDRAILS_CLI_TOKEN={API_KEY_FOR_GUARDRAILS}
     ```  

4. **Install Dependencies**  
   - Install required packages:  
     ```sh
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```  

5. **Run the Setup Script**  
   - Start the setup process:  
     ```sh
     python server_setup.py
     ```  
   - Wait for all Guardrails to finish installing & until you see "Server is running on ____"

## Technical Documentation
### System Architecture
Our platform is built as a **web-based AI tutoring system** with the following components:

### **User Interface (UI)**
Developed using **Flask**, the UI includes:
- Input fields for questions and PDF uploads.
- Display area for AI-generated answers.
- Navigation between chatbot, study plans, quizzes, and summarizer.

### **Backend Processing**
- Built with **Python & Flask** for handling user requests.
- Interacts with the AI model for processing queries and generating responses.

### **AI Model**
- **OpenAI's GPT-4** for natural language understanding and response generation.
- Uses OpenAI API to create study plans, quizzes, and summaries.

### **Data Processing**
- Uses **PyPDF2** to extract text from uploaded PDFs.
- Implements **text cleaning and validation** to ensure quality content.


### **AI Model & Libraries**
